-- PROBLEM 1
-- GQ1 --------------------------------------------

-- a) Insertion violation uniqueness of primary key
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (1, 'Adams', 'History', 'FR', 18)

-- b) Insertion violation not-null value of primary key
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (null, 'Adams', 'History', 'FR', 18)

-- c) Insertion, deletion, and update query violating foreign key constraint
INSERT INTO Class VALUES ('New Class', 'W 13:30', 'R128', 105)
DELETE FROM Faculty WHERE fid = 104
UPDATE Class SET fid = 105

-- d) Retrieval query violates domain constraint
SELECT snum FROM Student WHERE sname = 16

-- GQ2 --------------------------------------------

-- CREATE INDEX idx_enrolled_snum_cname ON Enrolled (snum, cname);

-- After reviewing the SQL queries, we decided the Enroll table would be a good candidate for indexing. 
-- Specifically, it is used frequently in JOIN operations and accessed in queries 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.

-- Because cname and snum are frequently used, we can create a composite index on the combination of the 
-- two to optimize performance. This index is a secondary index because neither snum or cname are primary keys, 
-- but foreign keys that reference another tableâ€™s primary keys.
